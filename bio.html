        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Since my childhood I have been playing computers games and, sometimes, I was good at it. Years later I decided to be a game developer, I went to the Moscow State University
            and realize that there only math. Then spent 2 years in my country, learning some program languages and searching for a job, but then our goverment made a thing because of wich
            I went to the Canada to the St. Lawrence College.
